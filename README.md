## Useful GitHub Formatting for Readme

How to Link: This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks. Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in[ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

Task lists
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

- [x] Phase One
- [ ] Phase Two
- [ ] Phase Three
